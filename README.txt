Thanks for stopping by the fifecode repository. 

As I learn new programming concepts, I like to see if I can apply the ideas to something useful. Thus each program file serves as an example where I'm trying out something (such as a function, loop, if statement) to solve a problem or perform a task.

These programs are in Python, my first actual language.
(I'm not counting SQL, which use a lot in my data analyst job.)
In time, I hope to gain more skill with Python AND branch out into other programming languages. (stay tuned!)

Within these repository files, there are comments that may indicate related files that can be used along with the code.

E.g. As an input file, you can use 2022-pubs.txt when running input_pubfile_jrnls_extract_count_sort_write_file.py

Feel free to reach me with comments, suggestions, or questions at fife.speed@gmail.com

Have a great day.
